## **Variables**

Assign a variable like so:

```
x = 5
str = "Taber Sucks"
arr = [0,1,2,3,4]
```

Variables are made so you can call them again later on in the code:

```
x = 5
y = 1


return x + y
return x - y
```

Variable Types include:
* Integers
* Strings
* Arrays


## **Conditionals**
Expressions used in python:

```
* if 5 == 5:
	return True
  else:
  	return "What?"

* if string.startswith(z):
	return "ZZZZZZZ"
  elif string.startswith(w):
  	return "But of course"
```
